# Host discovery script 

So, I made this script as an attempt to automate the process of detecting legitmate (and suspicious) hosts on my network. 

## Dependencies: 

- nmap (Network Mapper)
- ip (Should be available in most Linux distibutions) 
- ipcalc (to get the subnet mask of a given network)
